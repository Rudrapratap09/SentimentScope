# SentimentScope
SentimentScope is a hybrid sentiment analysis system for classifying text reviews as positive or negative. It leverages a custom-trained Logistic Regression model with Word2Vec embeddings, augmented by BERTâ€™s DistilBERT for robust predictions. The project includes a Flask web app for real-time sentiment prediction, trained on the Kindle Reviews dataset. Features preprocessing with NLTK, MediaPipe, and BeautifulSoup, and model optimization via GridSearchCV.
